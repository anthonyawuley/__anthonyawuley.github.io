The FSALPS algorithm uses novel EC strategies to overcome premature convergence while simultaneously performing feature selection and classification. This research presents the FSALPS (Feature Selection Age Layered Population Structure) evolutionary algorithm. FSALPS performs effective feature subset selection and classification of varied supervised learning tasks. FSALPS uses a novel frequency count system to rank features in the GP population based on evolved feature frequencies.
